## Project Overview

### Goal

To apply the skills acquired over the past two years by undertaking an extensive project that showcases general development capabilities, along with visual and technical proficiency. The final product aims to be a modern front-end accommodation booking application that reflects both user-facing and admin-facing functionalities.

### Brief

Lanka Travel, a newly launched accommodation booking platform, requires a brand-new front end for their application. While they have outlined the necessary features, the design and user experience aspects are yet to be defined. Leveraging the official API documentation, this project involves planning, designing, and building a contemporary front-end application for accommodation bookings.

The project encompasses two main facets:

1. **Customer-Facing Side:** Where users can browse and book holidays at various venues.
2. **Admin-Facing Side:** Where authorized users can register and manage venues and bookings.

### User Stories

The client has outlined the following user stories to guide the development:

1. **Venue Browsing**
   - *As a user, I can view a list of venues.*
   - *As a user, I can search for a specific venue.*
   - *As a user, I can view a specific venue page by ID.*
   - *As a user, I can view a calendar with available dates for a venue.*

2. **User Authentication and Management**
   - *As a user with a `stud.noroff.no` email, I can register as a customer.*
   - *As a registered customer, I can create a booking at a venue.*
   - *As a registered customer, I can view my upcoming bookings.*
   - *As a user with a `stud.noroff.no` email, I can register as a venue manager.*
   - *As a registered venue manager, I can create, update, and delete venues I manage.*
   - *As a registered venue manager, I can view bookings for venues I manage.*
   - *As a registered user, I can log in.*
   - *As a registered user, I can update my avatar.*
   - *As a registered user, I can log out.*
